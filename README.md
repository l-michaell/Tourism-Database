The application we created can login to create and access a database with information on popular toursites. Users can add, delete, and update information on events near the toursites. They can also search for toursites by different conditions (such as lon/lat and fee) or by different attributes on any table. They also see information such as toursites in each country, events near each toursite, find sites hosting events over 1 hour long, and can see the ratings for different sites.
